.TH Logstalgia 1
.SH NAME
Logstalgia -  a website access log visualization tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIlogstalgia\fR
[\-x] [\-b] [\-p] [\-r] [\-WIDTHxHEIGHT] [\-f] [\-s] [\-u] [\-g name,regex,percent[,colour]] logfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlogstalgia\fR
replays or streams a standard web access log (eg access.log) as a retro arcade game-like simulation.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
\fIlogstalgia\fR's display is rendered using OpenGL and requires a 3D accelerated video card to run.

As \fIlogstalgia\fR is designed to playback logs in real time you will need a log from a fairly busy webserver to achieve interesting results (eg 100s of requests each minute).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
\fB\-b\fR
Balls disappear when hit by the paddle instead of bouncing back
.TP 8
\fB\-p\fR
Hide paddle
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Fullscreen
.TP
\fB\-WIDTHxHEIGHT\fR
Set the window size. If \-f is also supplied, will attempt to set the video mode to this also.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Simulation speed. Defaults to 1 (1 second-per-second)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
Page Summary update speed. Defaults to 5 (5 seconds)
.TP
\fB\-g name,regex,percent[,colour]\fR
Urls matching the given regex will appear under a new section with the given name using the given percentage of the screen. Colour may optionally be supplied in the common hexadecimal format (eg FF0000 for red)

If no groups are supplied the default groups are Images (image files), CSS (.css files) and Scripts (.js files).

If there is enough space remaining a catch-all group of Misc will appear as the last group.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Show full request ip/hostname
.TP
\fBlogfile\fR
The path to the access log file to read or '\-' if you wish to supply log entries via STDIN.
.SH EXAMPLES
Some command lines you might use to watch an access log:

.ti 10
\fIlogstalgia\fR LS_DATADIR/example.log

Watch the example log file using the default settings.

.ti 10
tail \-f /var/log/apache/access.log | \fIlogstalgia\fR \-

Watch the default Apache access.log in real time as new requests come in (requires tail). Note than '\-' at the end is required for
\fIlogstalgia\fR
to know it needs to read from STDIN.

.ti 10
ssh user@yourserver.com tail \-f /var/log/apache/access.log | \fIlogstalgia\fR \-g "Ad Clicks,/adclick.php,30" -

Watch a remote Apache access.log via ssh. \-g groups together URLs requested containing the string '/adclick.php' under the heading 'Ad Clicks'.
.SH INTERFACE
The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first log entry read and is incremented according to the simulation speed (\-s).

The counter in the bottom right hand corner shows the number of requests displayed since the start of the current session.

Pressing space at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you may use the mouse to inspect the detail of individual requests.

Interactive keyboard commands:
.sp
.ti 10
(q) Debug Information
.ti 10
(c) Displays Logstalgia logo
.ti 10
(n) Jump forward in time to next log entry.
.ti 10
(+) Increase simulation speed.
.ti 10
(-) Decrease simulation speed.
.ti 10
(ESC) Quit
